Installation
============  

Dependencies
------------

* Python >= 3.7 
* `FSPS <https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps>`_ and `Python FSPS <https://dfm.io/python-fsps/current/>`_. Note that we need to set an environmental variable called SPS_HOME to make FSPS works. Please follow the instruction in FSPS website for this.
* `mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#>`_ for parallel processing.
* `emcee <https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for SED fitting with MCMC method.
* `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`_ and `h5py <https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/build.html>`_ (follow the installation instruction from the website).  


Installing piXedfit for the first time
--------------------------------------

* cd to a desired installation directory, clone **piXedfit**, and install.

.. code-block:: shell

	cd <install_dir>
	git clone https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit.git
	cd piXedfit
	python -m pip install .

* Set an environmental variable called PIXEDFIT_HOME that point to **piXedfit** parent directory.

.. code-block:: shell

	export PIXEDFIT_HOME="$PWD"
 
* The issue with the above command is that we need to do it every time we open a new terminal. Alternatively, we can add this environmental variable to .bashrc (add export PIXEDFIT_HOME="path_to_piXedfit" to the last line in the .bashrc file). 

.. code-block:: shell

	vi ~/.bashrc

Add the above line and then do

.. code-block:: shell

	source  ~/.bashrc

* To add the environmental variable permanently, we can add the same line to .bash_profile or .profile. In case of .bash_profile:

.. code-block:: shell

	vi ~/.bash_profile

Add the line and then do

.. code-block:: shell

	source ~/.bash_profile


Upgrading piXedfit
------------------

* cd to the installation directory, clone **piXedfit**, and install.

.. code-block:: shell

	cd <install_dir>
	git clone https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit.git temp
	cp -r temp/piXedfit temp/requirements.txt temp/setup.py piXedfit/
	rm -rf temp
	cd piXedfit
	python -m pip install .
