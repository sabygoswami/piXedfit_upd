Tutorials
=========

Some tutorials are provided in the form of jupyter notebooks and can be found in the github `repository <https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit/tree/main/examples>`_. Those tutorials demonstrate the analyses from raw data up to the SED fitting and retrieving maps of the properties of stellar population and dust. We classified the tutorials based on the wavelength range covered by the data sets.      

Analysis of FUV--FIR imaging data
---------------------------------
The tutorial on this analysis can be found `here <https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit/tree/main/examples/FUVtoFIR>`_.


Analysis of FUV--NIR imaging data combined with IFS data
--------------------------------------------------------

* With IFS data from the MaNGA survey: `FUVtoNIR_MaNGA <https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit/tree/main/examples/FUVtoNIR_MaNGA>`_

* With iFS data from the CALIFA survey: `FUVtoNIR_CALIFA <https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit/tree/main/examples/FUVtoNIR_CALIFA>`_
